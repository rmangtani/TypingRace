Jim and Anne will be in charge of the spring field day to be held in early June. They will ask their friends' aid to
get set up. There will be games for the boys and girls. The children will want to hike, ride their bikes, and swim.
This yearly event will be held in the new Peach Grove Park. Ruth has work to do on the plans for food for the day. Last
year Ruth spent most of her time helping the two cooks with many snacks.
