Hunt and peck (two-fingered typing), also known as Eagle Finger, is a common form of typing in which the typist presses
each key individually. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist must find each key by sight.
Use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been typed without glancing away from
the keys.
